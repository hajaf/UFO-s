The purpose of The analysis:To create a webpage and dynamic table that provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time namely date ,city, state, country, and shape.

# #Summary:
One drawback That I have observed, is that the filter is case sensitive. If for example ,the user tried to filter “Enter State” for NJ (New Jersey) all caps they would find no results the state must type with lower letters.
I would recommend editing the app.js to accept both lower case and upper-case letters. I would also recommend adding an image or color to the background.
